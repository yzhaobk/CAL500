    -- Million Song Dataset --
           -- CAL500 --

This folder contains the songs from the CAL500 dataset
(http://cosmal.ucsd.edu/cal/projects/AnnRet/)
obtained from The Echo Nest API on September 23, 2011
and put in the same format as the rest of MSD songs
(http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/)

Quick notes:
- relies on the list in 'cal500_EchoNest_IDs.txt' obtained
from the UCSD website
- only audio features should be considered 'safe', finding
song and artist starting from a track on the EN API is 'risky'

For the tag annotations, see the CAL500 website.

For questions regarding CAL500, please contact the CAL lab at UCSD.
